# OMDBandTasteDive and Wheel Of Fortune mini-game
This repository contains 2 mini-projects.
## OMDBandTasteDive
This one works with 2 APIs: TasteDive and OMDB. It receives list of films from a user, looks up similar movies and creates a new list with other recommended films based on their Rotten Tomatoes rating.
## Wheel Of Fortune
This project simulates popular tv show. You can add any amount of players and computer players (they also have difficulty setting). This project won't work out of the box, because it requires database of questions and quizes, but logic should be clear and understandable.
